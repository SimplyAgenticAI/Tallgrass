"""Subscriptions via Stripe Checkout.

This module never sees a card number. Checkout is a Stripe-hosted page: the
user is redirected there, enters payment details on Stripe's domain, and comes
back with nothing sensitive in hand. Entitlement is then set from a
signature-verified webhook rather than from the redirect, because a redirect
URL is attacker-controllable and a webhook is not.

# The tool replaces manual group research and hands back finished copy, so it
# sits well above a utility and well below the $100+ social-listening suites
# it competes against. $19 is low enough to be an easy yes without a
# procurement conversation, high enough to fund support and hosting.
#
# The annual price is ten months for twelve — a discount that is legible at a
# glance and needs no explaining.

# One difference between the tiers, and it is volume.

# The old lists claimed Sage, remix, ideas and export were Pro-only. Nothing
# in the code has ever enforced that — capture_allowed is the single gate in
# the app and it counts posts. So the pricing page was telling free users they
# could not have things they already had, which is the one direction a pricing
# page must never be wrong in: it argues against the product to the people
# still deciding whether it works.
#
# Holding features back also hides the thing worth paying for. Somebody who
# has never seen a remix has no reason to want more capture; somebody who has
# used it on their own winning post has an obvious one.
# Only what the money actually buys.
#
# The first line used to read "Everything in Free, with nothing held back",
# which states the obvious — nobody pays to receive less — and spends the most
# valuable line on the card sounding defensive. Pro differs from Free in one
# way, so the list says what that one way gets you rather than restating that
# it is a superset.
