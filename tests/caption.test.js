/* Which text block becomes the caption.
 *
 * Posts were arriving with bodies like
 *
 *   eStdrspono5el0cc6lalaln5rhh41 0Mifhf13r47a98g073a2uuo603ce8L
 *
 * interleaved with U+034F COMBINING GRAPHEME JOINER: sixty joiners in a
 * hundred and twenty characters, one after every visible letter. Facebook
 * plants these blocks to defeat text matching. The caption is chosen by
 * length, so a decoy longer than the real copy wins and the post arrives with
 * gibberish where its words should be. Some posts read correctly and some did
 * not, which is exactly what "whichever block happened to be longer" looks
 * like.
 *
 * I first called these ads. That was wrong. The evidence was that one
 * sample's first nine letters sorted to "sponsored" — and the next sample's
 * did not, which I noted and then ignored. They are decoys, not labels.
 *
 * THE PROPERTY THAT MATTERS: this decides which block becomes the caption and
 * nothing else. Every branch still captures the post. A post whose every
 * block is a decoy arrives with no caption, exactly like a post that never
 * had one — it does not go missing. That is the difference between this and
 * the change that cost a day.
 *
 * Written without literal emoji on purpose: escapes survive being rewritten
 * by tooling, and a mangled fixture here would fail for reasons that have
 * nothing to do with the code under test.
