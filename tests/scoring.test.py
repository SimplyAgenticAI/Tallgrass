"""The accuracy rules, held in place.

outliers.py decides every number the product asserts, and until now nothing
tested it. Each rule below was learned the hard way — a wrong figure shipped,
got noticed, got fixed — and each one is a rule precisely because the code
reads fine either way. A median that quietly includes failed extractions looks
exactly like one that doesn't.

So these are not tests that the maths runs. They reconstruct the specific
wrong answer the rule exists to prevent, and insist it is not produced.

Run: python tests/scoring.test.py
