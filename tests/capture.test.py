"""One bad post must not cost the whole batch.

Reported from a real scan: 197 posts captured, 147 delivered, then
"Dashboard returned 500". A 500 from /api/capture rejects everything in the
request, and the extension puts the whole batch back on the queue to fail the
same way next sweep — so a single unstorable post could strand fifty good ones
indefinitely.

These tests do not assert that capture works. They manufacture a post that
cannot be stored and insist the rest of the batch still lands, that the
failure is counted rather than hidden, and that the reason is recorded
somewhere the operator can read it.

Run: python tests/capture.test.py
