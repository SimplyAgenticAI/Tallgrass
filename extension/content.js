/* Tallgrass — Facebook capture.
 *
 * RESTORED from V1.7 (79fbd9f) at the operator's request: capture worked on
 * their real groups then and progressively stopped working through the
 * rewrites that followed. Everything after this point in the extension's
 * history was tuned against a reconstruction of Facebook's markup rather
 * than the real page, and each "fix" moved it further from working.
 *
 * Known trade-offs, deliberately accepted to get capture back:
 *   - Comments are captured again (they are stored but not ranked anywhere).
 *   - Engagement can occasionally read a number out of the post's own text.
 * Both are fixable once capture is confirmed working on a real group; the
 * order matters, because a correct number nobody ever captures is worth
 * nothing.
 *
 * Original header follows.
 *
 * Outlier content script.
 *
 * Facebook regenerates its class names per build, so nothing here keys off a
 * class — extraction hangs off ARIA roles, aria-labels, and visible text.
 * Those still drift, which is why this ships with an on-page HUD: when capture
 * goes quiet you can see whether the problem is "no posts matched", "matched
 * but no text", or "sent but the dashboard rejected it".

   * (promo2024.com) safe. Like every branch here it only decides the caption —
   * a post whose lone block is one of these is still captured, with none.
   *
   * Requiring a digit was tuned to that one sample. Casing was the second
   * guess and was tuned to the second sample. Both missed "mrukbzoeu.com",
   * which carries neither. The signal is not punctuation or case — it is that

   *
   * FIRST: the opening consonant cluster. Every language a domain gets named
   * in has a small set of clusters a word may begin with — "str", "ch", "pl".
   * "mr" is not among them, and neither is "kz". A generator does not know
   * that, so it produces openings no word has. Short labels are exempt because
   * acronyms are not words either and are perfectly real: NFL, ESPN, SHRM.
   *
   * SECOND: a run of five consonants with no vowel between them. "YjDuBghsl"
   * has "bghsl". Real names break for a vowel long before that. Five and not
   * four, because "TechCrunch" runs to four (chcr) and someone might paste it.
   *
   * y counts as a vowel throughout: it is the vowel in "MyStore", and calling
   * it a consonant would cost that real domain its caption.
   *
   * This is a heuristic about spelling, so it will never be perfect in either
   * direction. It is tuned to prefer a blank caption over a fabricated one,
   * which is the operator's explicit instruction: a post with nothing written
   * on it should arrive with nothing written on it.
