 * a freeze, not a pause.

 * throttled by. So while a tab is hidden the cadence comes from this side and
 * the content script only reacts, because message handlers were never
 * throttled — only timers were.
 *
 * Both halves of a step are sent from here. The wait between scrolling and
 * reading is itself a timer, and leaving it in the page would have put a
 * clamped 1100ms pause in the middle of every step and undone the point.
 *
 * The port doubles as the keep-alive. A worker with no events is shut down
 * after about thirty seconds, and traffic on a connected port is what resets
 * that — which this produces anyway, twice a step. If it is shut down
 * regardless, the port drops and the content script reconnects; nothing is
 * lost, because the page holds the scan state and this holds none of it.
