"""Outlier detection — the core of the product.

Ranking by raw engagement just surfaces whoever has the biggest audience.
What actually matters is which posts beat the baseline *for the place they
were posted in*: a 400-reaction post in a 2k-member group is a bigger signal
than a 4k-reaction post from a creator who averages 8k.

So every post is scored against the median of its own source (group/profile).
Median and MAD rather than mean and standard deviation, because engagement is
heavily right-skewed and a single viral post would drag a mean-based baseline
up enough to hide everything else.
