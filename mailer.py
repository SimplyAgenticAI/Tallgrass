"""Outbound email.

The app had no way to send email at all, which is why a password reset could
never arrive: nothing was failing to deliver, nothing was ever sent.

Deliberately stdlib SMTP rather than a provider SDK. Every mail service worth
using speaks SMTP, so this works with Resend, Postmark, SendGrid, Fastmail or
a self-hosted relay without adding a dependency or picking a winner.

Configure with:
    SMTP_HOST       smtp.gmail.com, smtp.resend.com, smtp.postmarkapp.com, ...
    SMTP_PORT       587 (STARTTLS, default) or 465 (implicit TLS)
    SMTP_USER       provider username, or the full address for Gmail
    SMTP_PASSWORD   provider password or API key (SMTP_PASS also accepted)
    MAIL_FROM       optional. Defaults to SMTP_USER with a display name.

SMTP_PASS is accepted as well as SMTP_PASSWORD, and MAIL_FROM is optional,
because the sibling app on this account already has working credentials under
those names — copying them across should not require renaming anything or
inventing a from-address that has to be verified somewhere first.

Unconfigured is a supported state, not an error. is_configured() is false, the
caller falls back to the operator-assisted path, and nobody is left staring at
an inbox waiting for something that was never coming.
