    one without the user doing anything at all.

    Two things keep this from being a hole a web page could use:

      * the custom header. A page cannot send it cross-origin without a CORS
        preflight, and this route sends no Access-Control-Allow-Origin, so
        the browser refuses the response. The extension is exempt from CORS
        for origins in its host_permissions, which is exactly the asymmetry
        wanted here.
      * the session cookie is SameSite=Lax, so a cross-site POST from another
        page carries no session at all and lands on the login redirect.

    It only rotates when it has to. Keys are stored hashed and cannot be read
    back, so issuing one used to mean minting one — and minting revokes
    whatever was in use. That turned every concurrent call into a fight: two
    batches hitting a stale key both asked for a replacement, the second
    rotation invalidated the first, and the extension chased a key that was
    revoked before it could spend it. A scan of fifty delivered six.

    So a caller that already holds a working key gets that key back
    unchanged. The extension presents what it has; if it still verifies and
    belongs to this account, nothing rotates and no other browser is kicked
    off. Rotation is left for the case it was meant for — a caller with no
    valid key at all.
